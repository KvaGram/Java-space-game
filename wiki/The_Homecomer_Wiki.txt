The homecomer is a Spaceship management survival game.
Your main goal is to manage the survival of a generational starship crew on a long journey.
This goal will take many years to complete, maybe even centuries.

Your crew needs to start families, raise children, teach their childeren how to take over the ship.
Your crew needs to negotiate with aliens, fight them if neccesary.
Your crew needs to gather resources from planets and asteroids.
Your crew needs to find their way home to Earth.
Your crew are you, and you are the crew.
And shall the crew die, then you die.

Welcome to The Homecomer (working title*)
