====== Basic centrifugal frame ======
Created Sunday 24 November 2019

Centrifugal frames generates gravity by extruding the connected modules outwards, and spin around the spinal axis of the ship.
Beyond that, it uses the same basic mounting system as the [[Basic Frame]].

The hydrolic and rotation systems require a bit of maintence every now and then.
They also take up a bit of space, resulting in less space for modules.

In combat and emergencies, the centrifuge stops spinneing, and the modules are retracted.
This protects the sensitive mechanical parts from damage.
