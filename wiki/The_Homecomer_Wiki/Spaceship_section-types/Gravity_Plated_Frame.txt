====== Gravity Plated Frame ======
Created Sunday 24 November 2019

The gravity-plated frame has a set of powerful artificial gravity plates wrapping around its section of the spine.
The plates generate a form of gravity that pulls anything towards them.
The gravity-plates are an expensive high-tech alternative to the centrifuge.
While this frame has slightly more volume-space for modules, the technology and materials needed to construct it is hard to come by. It also has a much higher power consumption-rate compared to the centrifuge.
