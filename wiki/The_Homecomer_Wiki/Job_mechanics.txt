Created Wednesday 27 November 2019

**What is a job?**
A job is a responsibility a [[Crewman]] have, usually shared with others.
Jobs onboard the [[Homeship]] does not have set hours, and the crewmen may work whenever they see fit.
A job could be anything from a service to labour, and may require different sets of [[Aptitudes.]]
Jobs normally have a monthly workload. This workload is shared with the assigned crewmen.
Unlike a [[Battlestation]], a crewman can, and should, have more than one job.

**Where do the jobs exist?**
Most jobs comes from modules, and the the work that needs doing in them.
Temporary jobs may show up at times.
Temporary jobs could be anything from careing for a child to working on a large upgrade or refit for the Homeship.
Jobs can be set in the [[Crew Management]] window or in a [[Module Management]] window for the module where the job is.

**Workloads and worklists**
Every job has a workload. The workload may be determined on a set amount, or it could be based on a tasklist.
A tasklist may be automatically generated each month, or set by the player.
Automatic tasklist are jobs involving service or maintenence. The number of tasks for those jobs depends of the clients needing service, and facilities requireing maintenence.
Tasklists set by a player, could be research, cunstruction, manufacturing, etc..


**Work produced**
A crewman assigned to a job will provide work.
The amount of work they produce is based on their [[Stress|Lingering Stress,]] [[Crew Traits|Traits]] and [[Crew Mechanics:Aptitudes|Aptitude]] skill-level.
If the work produced in total for a job is less than the monthly workload, the module may suffer effeciency penalties.
Likewise if the work produced is excessive, the module may have a bonus.

**Stress**
A crewman will recive stress from working a job.
The amount of stress recived from a job is based on the workload, and modified by [[Crew Traits]].
