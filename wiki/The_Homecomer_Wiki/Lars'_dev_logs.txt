Together with the wiki, I have decided to start a dev log. 
This will be brief summeries of what I am working on in the project, as well as notes.

An empihifany was made regarding the combat system.
Make it fully grid-based, and copy a bit from Puzzle Pirate's ship combat system.

I have migrated some of the design notes on section-frames into this wiki.

Last couple of days, I been trying to learn LWJGL 3.
It is complicated, and I have to re-learn some things I have forgotten about OpenGL.
Hopefully I don't have to write polygon-drawing codes and perspective matrecies from scratch.

Yesterday I worked on Erik's code for crewmen. It had some flaws. Same type of flaws I would have made earlier in my life as a programmer.
On the commute to work today, I was thinking about [[Job mechanics]], and how they would work.

The job mechanics page has been written.
